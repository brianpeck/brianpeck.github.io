After a long wait, I finally have my very own website!
Previously, my biggest blocker to getting this created was lack of a domain name.
[brianpeck.com][brianpeck] was expensive, [bpeck.com][bpeck] was in use, and I wasn't excited about trailing numbers or branding.
For some reason, I never tried looking into [brian-peck.com][brian-peck].
Well, yesterday the thought occured to me and I realized the domain was available and so I purchased it.
Thanks to [Jekyll], [GitHub] pages, and the theme from [mmtheme], I was able to whip together a website fairly quickly.

For now I simply have information about my current [research][research] projects and my [resume][resume].
If time allows, I might expand this blog.
Enjoy!
