After a long wait, I finally have my very own website!
Thanks to [Jekyll], [GitHub] pages, and the [minimal-mistakes][mmtheme] theme, I was able to whip together a website fairly quickly.

For now I simply have information about my current [research][research] projects and my [resume][resume].
If time allows, I might expand this blog.
Enjoy!
